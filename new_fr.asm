;Committing on GitHub is the act of pushing changes to a project's codebase. 
;It's a way to update and improve the code, add new features, or fix bugs. 
I'm sure that every programmer responsible for his code must make commits. 
That is the first step to become a part of programmer community.
;The process of committing is simple and efficient. 
;Developers can use a Git client to create a copy of the code, make changes, and then send the changes back to the original repository.

;The benefits of committing on GitHub are many. 
;It provides a platform for developers to showcase their skills and talent while contributing to the development of open-source projects. 
;It helps developers to learn new technologies, programming languages, and tools to make their work more efficient and effective. 
;Additionally, committing on GitHub helps developers to collaborate with other developers and learn from their experiences.

;Moreover, committing on GitHub opens opportunities for developers to network and build their reputation in the tech community. 
;GitHub offers a social platform where developers can connect with other developers and collaborate on projects. 
;It can make them visible to potential employers and increase their chances of getting hired.

;Finally, committing on GitHub for open source projects is a way of giving back to the community.
;Developers can help to improve the software that they use and benefit from. 
;It's a way to make a positive impact on society while developing their skills and knowledge.

;In conclusion, committing on GitHub is a cool way of collaborating and contributing to open source projects. 
;It offers a wealth of benefits to developers, including improving their skills, networking opportunities, and making a positive impact on society. 
No matter how you are tired you should find a couple of minutes to make commit for every important change in your code.
YOU MUST LEARN TO LOVE COMMITS;(OR YOU ARE DOOMED ((as this file)))
I encourage responsible and ethical use of GitHub, and urge everyone to use it for the greater good.
